# Welcome!

## This is the place to learn more about psychedelics, specifically LSD, Lysergic Acid Diethylamide!

### Intentions

1. Educate young adults on effects of LSD
2. Promote mental health

### What will this website feature?

1. Daily check-in w/ short descriptions of research
2. Questionnaire's answered by young adults
3. Interviews w/ young adults who have experimented w/ psychedelics (podcast format).
4. Anonymous pictures of eyes/pupils under the influence
5. History/Information of LSD

### What's my question?

What are the behavioral and neuropharmacological effects of psychoactive drugs such as LSD in young adults (ages 17-25), in regards to depression, anxiety, and addiction? 

### Some interesting articles to look at:

## What is LSD?

Lysergic acid diethylamide, commonly referred to as LSD, or “acid,” is considered the best known and most researched psychedelic drug. LSD is active at exceptionally small doses (around 20 micrograms) and is taken orally, sometimes as droplets or more commonly on blotter paper and absorbed on the tongue and then swallowed.

## What are the uses for LSD?

Scientists considered psychedelics to be promising treatments as an aid to therapy for a broad range of psychiatric diagnoses, including alcoholism, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, and depression. Recent results from epidemiological studies have shown lower rates of mental health disorders and suicide among people who have used psychedelics like LSD.
LSD is currently in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, the most heavily criminalized category for drugs. Schedule I drugs are considered to have a “high potential for abuse” and no currently accepted medical use – though when it comes to LSD there is significant evidence to the contrary on both counts.

## How can we reduce the harms associated with LSD?

LSD is active at very low doses (around 20 micrograms) and can have very different effects at what are only small differences in amounts and from person to person. Appropriate dosing is important. Individual ¼” squares of LSD on blotter paper (called “tabs”) usually contain roughly between 30-100 micrograms, and a common dosage range is between 50-150 micrograms.
LSD’s effects often do not become noticeable for as long as an hour after taking it, with a gradual intensification over the first 1Can -2 hours. To avoid what may be an overly intense experience from a high dose, the “start low, go slow” method is best for anyone using LSD – especially for people inexperienced with LSD or other psychedelics.
LSD, like other psychedelics, often evokes conscious awareness of subconscious thoughts and feelings, such as repressed memories, feelings about life circumstances, fantasies, or deep fears. Thus, if someone makes the decision to use LSD, it is important for that person to be prepared to deal with unusual – and perhaps even challenging – thoughts, images, and feelings in an open and thoughtful manner. It is also best to use LSD with someone who is not under the influence of the substance (a “guide”) who can prevent them from engaging in dangerous activities.

## Can LSD be used as medicine for therapy?

Yes. Fully legal research programs in the mid-20th century that involved tens of thousands of patients found that carefully monitored and controlled use of LSD may be beneficial for many psychiatric disorders, personal and spiritual development, and creative enhancement for healthy people.
However, after LSD was banned in 1970, clinical research to evaluate its medical safety and efficacy was effectively halted until the late 90s and early 2000s.
Today, there are more than a dozen studies taking place to evaluate the medical safety and efficacy of psychedelics, including LSD. Although much of the early LSD research did not stand up to today’s standards, as they often lacked a placebo control group or double-blinding procedures (in which neither the subject of the research nor the investigators knew whether the subject received LSD or placebo).
Nevertheless, their promising findings have been revisited and spurred a resurgence of new, more rigorous research on the potential benefits of psychedelics as a treatment for cluster headache, anxiety, addiction to alcohol and other drugs, and depression, as well as neuro-imaging experiments furthering the understanding of its effects on the brain.
