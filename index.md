## What is LSD?
Lysergic acid diethylamide, commonly referred to as LSD, or “acid,” is considered the best known and most researched psychedelic drug. LSD is active at exceptionally small doses (around 20 micrograms) and is taken orally, sometimes as droplets or more commonly on blotter paper and absorbed on the tongue and then swallowed.

## What are the uses for LSD?
Scientists considered psychedelics to be promising treatments as an aid to therapy for a broad range of psychiatric diagnoses, including alcoholism, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, and depression. Recent results from epidemiological studies have shown lower rates of mental health disorders and suicide among people who have used psychedelics like LSD.
LSD is currently in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, the most heavily criminalized category for drugs. Schedule I drugs are considered to have a “high potential for abuse” and no currently accepted medical use – though when it comes to LSD there is significant evidence to the contrary on both counts.

## How can we reduce the harms associated with LSD?
LSD is active at very low doses (around 20 micrograms) and can have very different effects at what are only small differences in amounts and from person to person. Appropriate dosing is important. Individual ¼” squares of LSD on blotter paper (called “tabs”) usually contain roughly between 30-100 micrograms, and a common dosage range is between 50-150 micrograms.
LSD’s effects often do not become noticeable for as long as an hour after taking it, with a gradual intensification over the first 1Can -2 hours. To avoid what may be an overly intense experience from a high dose, the “start low, go slow” method is best for anyone using LSD – especially for people inexperienced with LSD or other psychedelics.
LSD, like other psychedelics, often evokes conscious awareness of subconscious thoughts and feelings, such as repressed memories, feelings about life circumstances, fantasies, or deep fears. Thus, if someone makes the decision to use LSD, it is important for that person to be prepared to deal with unusual – and perhaps even challenging – thoughts, images, and feelings in an open and thoughtful manner. It is also best to use LSD with someone who is not under the influence of the substance (a “guide”) who can prevent them from engaging in dangerous activities.

## Can LSD be used as medicine for therapy?
Yes. Fully legal research programs in the mid-20th century that involved tens of thousands of patients found that carefully monitored and controlled use of LSD may be beneficial for many psychiatric disorders, personal and spiritual development, and creative enhancement for healthy people.
However, after LSD was banned in 1970, clinical research to evaluate its medical safety and efficacy was effectively halted until the late 90s and early 2000s.
Today, there are more than a dozen studies taking place to evaluate the medical safety and efficacy of psychedelics, including LSD. Although much of the early LSD research did not stand up to today’s standards, as they often lacked a placebo control group or double-blinding procedures (in which neither the subject of the research nor the investigators knew whether the subject received LSD or placebo).
Nevertheless, their promising findings have been revisited and spurred a resurgence of new, more rigorous research on the potential benefits of psychedelics as a treatment for cluster headache, anxiety, addiction to alcohol and other drugs, and depression, as well as neuro-imaging experiments furthering the understanding of its effects on the brain.

## Scientific history of LSD
LSD was discovered in 1938 by Albert Hofmann, a Swiss chemist working at Sandoz Laboratories. He later became the first person to experience the drug’s psychoactive effects after he accidentally ingested a small amount in 1943. The effects Hofmann reported included, “restlessness, dizziness, a dreamlike state and an extremely stimulated imagination.”
Sandoz sent samples of LSD to psychiatrists, scientists, and mental health professionals around the world for more research. For the next two decades, thousands of experiments with LSD led to a better understanding of how LSD affected consciousness by interacting with the brain’s serotonin neurotransmitter system.

## Cultural history of LSD
In the 1960s, non-medical use of LSD was popularized by poets and musicians, like Allen Ginsberg and The Beatles, and outspoken advocates like Harvard professors Tim Leary and Ram Dass (then Richard Alpert).
In the popular press and among politicians, LSD became associated with this youth-led social movement steeped in antiwar demonstrations, sexual experimentation, and cultural upheaval, which largely ignored some of the potential downfalls of widespread use in uncontrolled settings.
LSD’s widespread popularity at the time meant that it was often used in chaotic settings and sometimes by people who did not know what they were taking or who were otherwise unprepared for the experience. Media began reporting on strange behavior and negative outcomes associated with LSD use.
In 1968 President Nixon declared drugs to be “public enemy number one” and in 1970 signed the Controlled Substances Act, placing LSD in Schedule I. Nixon’s domestic policy chief admitted decades later that their declaration of a war on drugs was a tool to vilify the anti-war left, Black people, and other minorities.

# FAQ's
 ## Is LSD addictive?
LSD is not considered to be addictive nor does it cause compulsive use. One reason is that the intense, long-lasting experience, which can be physically and mentally challenging, may cause people using LSD non-medically to limit their frequency of use.
Another reason is that the human body quickly builds tolerance to LSD, such that users require much higher doses after only a few days of repeated use, making it extremely difficult to have any effect after more than four days of repeated usage.
Because of the similar brain receptors involved in their effects, cross-tolerance occurs with psilocybin and LSD, which means that if someone takes psilocybin mushrooms one day, the effects of taking LSD the next day will be diminished.

## Can “microdosing” be used to enhance creativity?
Microdosing is a practice that has gained much interest recently that involves regularly taking doses of LSD too small to cause noticeable changes in consciousness (around 5-10 micrograms) to enhance creativity and problem solving.
A series of experiments between 1954 and 1962 involved nearly 1,000 participants in monitored settings to gauge any effects from LSD, including artists, academics, and many others. Some of the results from those experiments, along with a pilot study in 1966 that tested whether low dose LSD (around 50 micrograms) could aid problem solving, showed trends of possible enhanced functioning in subjects.
More recently, a team of neuroscientists in London have been studying LSD’s effects on the brain using cutting edge imaging technology. Their preliminary findings are showing support for LSD’s use in enhancing creativity and problem solving abilities, as well as making progress toward understanding the biological mechanisms behind these effects.
